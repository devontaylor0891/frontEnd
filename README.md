# frontEnd
another crack at it


# To Use...

Clone the repo

cd into the frontEnd folder

`npm install`

Currently using dummy data on a mock server.
To use the mock data and fire up the app:


1. install json-server globally
run `npm install -g json-server` (you may need to sudo this)
2. navigate to frontEnd/src/assets/api
3. run `json-server --watch db.json`
this fires up a mock server at localhost:3000
4. then navigate back to the root folder.
5. run `ng serve`
