# frontEnd
another crack at it

Currently using dummy data on a mock server.
To use the mock data:
1. install json-server globally
run `npm install -g json-server` (you may need to sudo this)
2. navigate to frontEnd/src/assets/api
3. run `json-server --watch db.json`
this fires up a mock server at localhost:3000
4. then run your `ng serve` on the auth0-rwas branch and click search in the header

Working to build out an Angular app.

# To Use...
