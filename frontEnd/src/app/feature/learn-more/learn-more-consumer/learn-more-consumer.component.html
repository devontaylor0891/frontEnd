					<h3>Searching Explained...</h3>
					<div #step1>
						<!-- VIDEO SHOULD BE EMBEDDED HERE -->
						<video width="320" height="240" controls>
							<source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
							Your browser does not support the video tag.
						</video>
						<p>
							The most important part of your search starts with <b>where you are</b>>. After all, you don’t really care what food is being delivered
							3 hours away from you, do you? This is about local food.
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							A note about privacy: We don’t track you. We use the location you provide only to tailor your search results. That’s it.
							No bull.
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							Our search finds all the deliveries and pickups scheduled <b>within a given radius of your location</b>. It then shows you the products
							and producers associated with those results, and even the details about the deliveries and pickups themselves. This
							gives you all the information you need.
						</p>
						<p>
							Looking specifically for veggies? <b>Filter</b> for produce and see the Products View. Want to order from just one producer that
							you already know? See the results from the Producers View. Or are you only available on Saturdays? Our Calendar View
							will show you what’s happening when.
						</p>
					</div>

					<h3>Ordering Explained...</h3>
					<div #step2>
						<!-- VIDEO SHOULD BE EMBEDDED HERE -->
						<p>
							Now that you’ve seen what’s on offer, you can <b>start building your order</b>. It’s just like ordering anything else online – start
							adding things to your cart! There is one special difference: because OLF is an online farmers’ market, that means
							when you order products from different producers, you are really creating multiple shopping carts. (What does this
							mean? Let us show you. – multiple carts video.)
						</p>
						<p>
							Once you’ve added one item to your cart, you might want to check out the rest of the products from that producer by visiting
							their store. They’ve probably got more great products you’ll love!
						</p>
						<p>
							After your cart is full, review your order. When you’ve confirmed you have what you want, continue
							to the checkout page. This is where OLF diverges from traditional online shopping once again: Your products won’t
							be shipped, so you’ll have to <b>choose how and when to get your order</b> based on the options the producer has set up.
							You can see what those options are by selecting a location.
						</p>
						<p>
							After making the appropriate selection, fill out any extra details like a comment or special instructions for the producer,
							or your address if you chose delivery. Then <b>hit ‘Confirm’ and you’re done</b>! We send your order on to the Producer.
							Once they review and accept your order, you’ll get a confirmation email.
						</p>
					</div>

					<h3>Delivery/Pick-up Explained...</h3>
					<div #step3>
						<p>
							<b>And now the payoff!</b> When the time comes, either you’ll go to the Producer’s location (they’re stall at the market or somewhere
							else, they’re farm, another drop-off point) or they’ll come to you. You get your order and pay them directly.
