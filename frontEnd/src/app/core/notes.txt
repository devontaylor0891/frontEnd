from checkout - call cartService.confirmAndSendOrder

cartService.confirmAndSendOrder
  - builds the products Array
  - calls getProductsCurrentQuantities
    - this makes a call to the api for each product - returns entire product
    - after the last call is made, compareProductQuantities is called
      - compareProductQuantities  - if the qtyOrdered is less than or equal to qtyAvailable, set orderQtyOkay to true and call buildCartAndSendOrder
                                  - if qtyOrdered is too much, emit the NotOkayArray via the subscription _orderQuantitiesToChange
        - when _orderQuantitiesToChange is emitted, checkout subscribes - opens a modal to accept changes, reloads cart on accept

- the buildCartAndSendOrder should be called, posts order via the api
